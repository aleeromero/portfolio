		<p> When it comes to fashion I am a total freak. Look Books are my favorite type of videos to both film and edit. This was my first ever Fall Look Book to film. It was also my first time creating my own remix to the song Closer by the Chainsmokes ft. Halsey using different songs. The song remix was all done by me.  </p>

		<p> This was the first ever Look Book video I ever made and what an experince it was. I was heading into my senior year in High School and I thought what better way to start the new school year than to film a couple of outfit ideas to rock the year. </p>
